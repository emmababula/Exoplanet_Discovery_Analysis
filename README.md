# Exoplanet_Discovery_Analysis

This project explores publicly available exoplanet data using interactive visualizations in Tableau. The goal is to uncover trends in discovery methods, planet characteristics, and star system properties across decades of exoplanet research.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on exploring the nature and discovery of exoplanets:
- How has the rate of exoplanet discoveries changed over time?
- What are the most common detection methods?
- How do planet mass and radius correlate?

The visualizations were created using a dataset of confirmed exoplanets from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS).
